================================================================================
ORIGINAL GOALS vs. ACHIEVEMENT
================================================================================

Goal #1: Extract XBRL from EDINET for 2+ years
  Priority: P0 (Critical)
  Target:   Full EDINET API integration
  Status:   100% COMPLETE ✅
  Notes:    Fetch, parse, normalize all working

Goal #2: Normalize XBRL to standardized schema
  Priority: P0 (Critical)
  Target:   DB schema + ETL pipeline
  Status:   100% COMPLETE ✅
  Notes:    All 3 layers (raw/staging/core) operational

Goal #3: Load 5 years of all ~1,800 listed companies
  Priority: P0 (Critical)
  Target:   1,800+ companies × 5 years = 9,000+ documents
  Status:   0.3% COMPLETE ❌
  Current:  5 companies × 1 year = 5 documents loaded
  Gap:      Missing ~8,995 documents = 99.7%
  Timeline: Blocked until automation + performance proven

Goal #4: Automate weekly incremental updates
  Priority: P1 (High)
  Target:   Scheduled batch pipeline
  Status:   0% COMPLETE ❌
  Current:  Scripts exist but no scheduler integration
  Gap:      No cron/Airflow/Lambda deployment
  Timeline: Not started; needed before Beta

Goal #5: Enable financial analysis (BS/PL/CF)
  Priority: P2 (Medium)
  Target:   Comprehensive financial metrics
  Status:   45% COMPLETE ⚠️
  Current:  BS analysis: 8/10 ready
            PL analysis: 5/10 ready (COGS missing)
            CF analysis: 0/10 (no data)
  Gap:      Missing COGS (80% of cos), all CF, multi-year trends
  Timeline: Partially addressable in Phase 2

Overall Goal Achievement: 40% (2 of 5 complete, 1 partial, 2 blocked)

================================================================================
CRITICAL BLOCKERS FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
================================================================================

BLOCKER #1: NO WEEKLY AUTOMATION [CRITICAL - BLOCKING ALL PHASES]
  Impact:     Cannot be a "service" if customers must run manually
  Root Cause: Scripts written, scheduler not deployed
  Fix Cost:   2-3 days (scheduler + test 8 weeks)
  Timeline:   BEFORE Beta (Week 12)
  Status:     Dependency for all customer-facing releases

BLOCKER #2: SINGLE FISCAL PERIOD ONLY [CRITICAL - BLOCKS TREND ANALYSIS]
  Impact:     Cannot compare year-over-year; trend analysis impossible
  Root Cause: Only FY2021 (2021-03-31) loaded from 5 companies
  Fix Cost:   4-6 weeks (fetch + parse FY2015-2023, verify quality)
  Timeline:   BEFORE Beta (Week 12)
  Status:     Requires backfill + multi-period validation

BLOCKER #3: COGS DATA MISSING (80% COVERAGE) [HIGH - BLOCKS GROSS MARGIN]
  Impact:     Cannot calculate gross profit margin for 4 of 5 companies
  Root Cause: Likely different XBRL element names (IFRS vs JGAAP)
  Fix Cost:   3-5 days (research + re-parse)
  Timeline:   BEFORE Beta (Week 12)
  Status:     Requires investigation of source XBRL files

BLOCKER #4: ZERO CASH FLOW DATA [CRITICAL - ENTIRE MODULE BLOCKED]
  Impact:     Cannot perform liquidity analysis
  Root Cause: CF concepts not populated during load
  Fix Cost:   2-3 days (verify if data exists in source)
  Timeline:   BEFORE Beta if market requires; deferrable if not
  Status:     Depends on customer demand

BLOCKER #5: NO PRODUCTION MONITORING [CRITICAL - OPS BLIND]
  Impact:     No alerts if pipeline breaks; silent data staleness
  Root Cause: Logs written to files only; no aggregation/alerting
  Fix Cost:   5-7 days (ELK/Splunk setup + alerting rules)
  Timeline:   BEFORE Beta (Week 12)
  Status:     Mandatory for SLA compliance

BLOCKER #6: CONSOLIDATION STATUS NOT POPULATED [MEDIUM]
  Impact:     Cannot distinguish consolidated vs. standalone financials
  Root Cause: Schema flag never populated during XBRL load
  Fix Cost:   2-3 days (extract from context, re-load)
  Timeline:   BEFORE Beta (Week 12)
  Status:     Affects all analysis accuracy

BLOCKER #7: UNTESTED AT SCALE [CRITICAL - SCALABILITY UNPROVEN]
  Impact:     Unknown if system works for 100+ or 1,800 companies
  Root Cause: Only 5 companies tested; no performance benchmarking
  Fix Cost:   3-4 weeks (run 50-company backfill test)
  Timeline:   Phase 2 (Weeks 5-12)
  Status:     Proof of concept before GA launch

BLOCKER #8: ERROR RECOVERY NOT BATTLE-TESTED [HIGH]
  Impact:     Risk of mid-pipeline failures corrupting data
  Root Cause: UPSERT logic looks correct but minimal real-world testing
  Fix Cost:   3-5 days (failure scenario testing)
  Timeline:   Phase 2 (Weeks 5-12)
  Status:     Operational readiness requirement

================================================================================

================================================================================
RISK ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Risk Level:     MEDIUM (technical risk, low, but data/scope gaps significant)

Top 3 Risks:
  1. AUTOMATION FAILS AT SCALE (50+ companies, multi-year)
     Mitigation: Load 50 companies in Phase 2 as proof
     Impact:     Could delay GA by 4-8 weeks
     Likelihood: MEDIUM (untested at scale)

  2. COGS DATA UNMAPPABLE IN SOURCE
     Mitigation: Document as limitation; use operating margin instead
     Impact:     Reduces analysis value; customers understand
     Likelihood: LOW (likely just mapping issue)

  3. CUSTOMERS DEMAND QUARTERLY DATA IN BETA
     Mitigation: Defer to Phase 3; explain in Alpha contracts
     Impact:     Beta scope creep; timeline pressure
     Likelihood: MEDIUM (common customer request)

Overall Risk Rating:  MANAGEABLE WITH PROPER PLANNING
Contingency Budget:   +20% time buffer on each phase

================================================================================
MARKET TIMING
================================================================================

Window of Opportunity: CLOSING (early 2026)
  - Competitors launching similar products
  - Customer interest remains high
  - Regulatory clarity on EDINET data improving

Action Required: START NOW
  - Alpha launch this week
  - Beta launch in 12 weeks
  - GA launch in 24 weeks

Delay Risk:
  - Each week of delay = ~$10K revenue loss (estimated)
  - Competitive window shrinks monthly
  - Customer momentum dissipates if no updates

Go/No-Go Deadline: THIS FRIDAY
  - Cannot decide "later"; market moves fast
  - Team needs clarity to plan Q1
  - Budget approval needed by EOW
