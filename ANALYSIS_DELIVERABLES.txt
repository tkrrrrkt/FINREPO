  ⚠️ Limitations clearly documented (needs finalization)
  ⚠️ Team onboarded (pending)

Must-Have for Beta Success:
  ❌ Weekly automation operational (not done yet - Phase 2 task)
  ❌ Monitoring/alerting deployed (not done yet - Phase 2 task)
  ⚠️ COGS/CF data gaps resolved (not done yet - Phase 2 task)
  ❌ 50+ company backfill validated (not done yet - Phase 2 task)
  ❌ 99.5% uptime SLA met (not done yet - Phase 2 task)

Must-Have for GA Success:
  ❌ 1,800+ companies loaded (not done yet - Phase 3 task)
  ❌ 5+ year historical data available (not done yet - Phase 3 task)
  ❌ 99.5% SLA maintained for 8 weeks (not done yet - Phase 3 task)
  ❌ 10+ paying customers signed (not done yet - Phase 3 task)

================================================================================
RISK ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Risk Level: MEDIUM (manageable with proper planning)

Top Risks:

Risk #1: AUTOMATION FAILS AT SCALE
├─ Likelihood: MEDIUM
├─ Impact: HIGH (could delay GA 4-8 weeks)
├─ Mitigation: Test 50-company backfill in Phase 2
└─ Contingency: +$20K budget, +4 weeks timeline

Risk #2: COGS DATA UNMAPPABLE
├─ Likelihood: LOW
├─ Impact: MEDIUM (reduces analysis value)
├─ Mitigation: Document limitation; use operating margin instead
└─ Contingency: Customers understand tradeoff

Risk #3: CUSTOMER DEMANDS QUARTERLY DATA
├─ Likelihood: MEDIUM
├─ Impact: MEDIUM (scope creep in Beta)
├─ Mitigation: Defer to Phase 3; explain in contracts
└─ Contingency: +4 weeks if needed for GA

Risk #4: DATABASE PERFORMANCE DEGRADES
├─ Likelihood: LOW (untested at scale)
├─ Impact: HIGH (production SLA failure)
├─ Mitigation: Load testing + partitioning strategy in Phase 2
└─ Contingency: Database optimization (2-3 weeks)

Risk #5: EDINET API RATE LIMITING
├─ Likelihood: LOW
├─ Impact: MEDIUM (backfill takes longer)
├─ Mitigation: Stagger requests over longer period
└─ Contingency: +2-4 weeks backfill timeline

Overall Risk Rating: MANAGEABLE
Contingency Budget: +20% on each phase timeline

================================================================================
FINAL VERDICT
================================================================================

Question: "Is FINREPO ready to release as a service?"

Answer:
  ❌ NO for production service (NOT READY)
     Gaps: Automation, monitoring, consolidation, scale testing, data gaps
     Timeline: 6 months minimum

  ✅ YES for internal alpha (READY NOW)
     Scope: 5 companies, single period, manual execution
     Value: Validate use cases, gather feedback
     Cost: Minimal (~$5K)
     Risk: Low

  🟡 MAYBE for customers in 6 months (CONDITIONAL)
     Depends on: Phase 2 execution, market feedback, resource availability
     Path: Alpha (4w) → Beta (8w) → Production (12+w)
     Investment: ~$210K total
     Revenue: $500K+/year (projected)

RECOMMENDATION:
  1. Approve Alpha release immediately (this week)
  2. Commit to Beta engineering (Weeks 5-12)
  3. Target production GA (Weeks 13+)
  4. Review at Week 12 gate before proceeding to Phase 3

This is a viable product with strong fundamental technology.
With proper execution on this roadmap, production launch is achievable in 6 months.
